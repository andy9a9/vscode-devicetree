# DeviceTree Language Support for Visual Studio Code

More than just a syntax highlighter for DeviceTree files in VSCode.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

This extension provides comprehensive syntax highlighting for Device Tree Source (DTS) files, including:

- **Comments**: Line comments (`//`) and block comments (`/* */`)
- **Preprocessor directives**: `#include` statements with file paths
- **Node definitions**: Node names, labels, and addresses (`label: node@address { }`)
- **Properties**: Cell arrays (`<...>`) with references, numbers, and constants
- **Data types**:
  - Strings (`"compatible"`, `"okay"`, ...)
  - Numbers (decimal `100000`, ...)
  - Node references (`&pinctrl_set1`, `&pinctrl_set2`, ...)
  - Constants (`IMX8MP_CLK_IPP_DO_CLKO1`, `IMX8MP_SYS_PLL1_80M`, ...)
